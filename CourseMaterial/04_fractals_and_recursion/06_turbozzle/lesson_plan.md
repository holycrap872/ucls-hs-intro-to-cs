## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Turbozzle worksheet loaded up in Schoology
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fekLawCFuocIC7UNs41wR1hAvdX_QMzMMIOz599dnUU
- Turbozzle "Skeleton" loaded up in Schoology
    - https://github.com/holycrap872/turbozzle/tree/for_students

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Functions
    - Robozzle
    - vscode
- Turbozzle
    - Explain rules
        - Need to get to all of the yellow w/o hitting black
        - Once get all yellow, the turtle spins in celebration
    - Do walkthrough
        - Different levels/files
        - 50 pixel increments
        - `forward()` requires no arguments
        - `left()` and `right()` require arguments
    - Show students how to do a split screen
    - How is this similar to/different from Robozzle?
        - Similar because controlling motion with functions
        - Different because more powerful (have variables)
    - Show final level (tree)
        - Example of recursion
        - Wouldn't be possible in Robozzle
- Go!
    - Work with a partner, but each person needs to submit their own worksheet
    - LOTS of absences at this point in the year... makes it hard
