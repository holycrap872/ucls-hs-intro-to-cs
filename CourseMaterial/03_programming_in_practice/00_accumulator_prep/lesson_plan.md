## Essential Questions

- How do we use loops to model repeating patterns?
- How can we utilize the accumulator pattern?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson is to prepare the slower students for accumlators. This
is because 50% of students get tripped up with the Grok question that asks you
to reverse a string. By harping on the "accumulator" pattern, they won't become
too frustrated.
