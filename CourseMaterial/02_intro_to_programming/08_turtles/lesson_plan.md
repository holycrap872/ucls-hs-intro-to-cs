## Essential Questions

- How should we visualize if/elif/else and loops?
- How do we use loops to model repeating patterns?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson is to prepare students for loops. This is because Grok's
loop lesson is a big jump in difficulty. Therefore, this lesson is intended to
ease the students into the syntax and appreciate loops as things that can
exploit patterns. In particular, I really stress the "logic puzzle-ness" of
being able to identify and exploit patterns with loops.

    - Some example "real life" programs
        - Have them come up with stuff
        - Loop as a hiking trail
    - Loop as a series of patterns
        - Logic puzzle: can you identify the pattern at the heart of the problem?

    - Little "turtle" that you control
    - Show code
    - Make a square
    - All about finding the pattern

    - Read through
    - Show examples of:
        - How to comment out code
        - How to exit screen
    - Go!

#### Possible Extensions

Use the turtle library to "draw" out an input binary string. For example, the
string "101" would result in a 1, then a 0, then a 1 being "drawn"
