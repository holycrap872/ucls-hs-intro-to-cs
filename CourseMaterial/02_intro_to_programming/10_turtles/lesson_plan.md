## Essential Questions

- How should we visualize if/elif/else and loops?
- How do we use loops to model repeating patterns?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson is to reinforce and visualize loops as taught in Grok.
In particular, I really stress the "logic puzzle-ness" of being able to identify
and exploit patterns with loops.

### Setup

- GoogleDoc about loops/turtles loaded up into Schoology
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M3QkPWw4FBevTRVVvPYrpMLnrxy3whFOzJG3GN-qLyo
- YouTube video loaded up
    - "I like turtles": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNry4PE93Y

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - String functions
    - if, if/else, if/elif/else
    - What's been hard?
    - What's been interesting?
- How do we think of if/elif/else in real life
    - Various analogies
        - If hungry then eat
    - Some example "real life" programs
        - Have them come up with stuff
        - If/else as a fork in a trail
- How do we think about loops
    - Iterating through a list of things
    - Various analogies
        - Go to school learn, go home
    - Some example "real life" programs
        - Have them come up with stuff
        - Loop as a hiking trail
    - Loop as a series of patterns
        - Logic puzzle: can you identify the pattern at the heart of the problem?
- Loops in python
    - For loops
    - Bunch of examples
    - Iterates through
- Turtles
    - Famous way to teach programming
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNry4PE93Y
    - Little "turtle" that you control
    - Show code
    - Make a square
    - All about finding the pattern
- Handle out classwork
    - Read through
    - Show examples of:
        - How to comment out code
        - How to exit screen
    - Go!

#### Possible Extensions

Use the turtle library to "draw" out an input binary string. For example, the
string "101" would result in a 1, then a 0, then a 1 being "drawn"
