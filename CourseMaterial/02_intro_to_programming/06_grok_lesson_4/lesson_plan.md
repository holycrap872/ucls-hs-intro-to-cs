## Essential Questions

## Lesson Plan

Grok Module 4 is a bit of a reprieve since it's mostly a review. Therefore,
students will be given the chance to reflect on everything that they've done
over the past few classes: conditionals, "Two Questions", and `input()`. After
this, students will talk about how to get the most out of modules since they are
so text heavy. The class will discuss the best ways to read/understand
documentation.
