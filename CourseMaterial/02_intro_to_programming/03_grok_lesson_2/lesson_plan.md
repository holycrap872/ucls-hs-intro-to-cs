## Lesson Plan

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Variables
    - `int`
    - Mad libs
- TIL Entries
    - Find some good ones and put into slide show
- Python primitives
    - What can we do with integers
        - `+`, `*`, `-`, `print()`
    - What can we do with strings
        - `+`, `*`, `print()`, `input()`, `len()`
- `len()` function
    - Do sample problem from Grok about length of string together
    - Emphasize how confusing Grok's use of color is
        - If two colors on same line, means asking a question to user (`input`)
- Start Grok

### Homework

- TIL Entry
- Finish lesson 2 of Grok
- Prep for quiz
