## Essential Question

- How do we make programs that react to their environment?
- What is the best way to search for a desired value?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, students will be given a chance to use conditionals in a
creative way. In particular, they will create a "connections-esque" game where
they have to figure out which of a set of words a user is thinking of simply by
asking y/n questions.
