## Essential Questions

- What is recursion?
- How can recursion be used to simplify complex problems?

## Lesson Plan

- Mandelbrot movie ready to go
- `mandelbrot_worksheet.docx` printed out
- Drawing supplies:
    - Tape
    - Regular paper
    - Colored pencils
    - Rulers

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Debugging
    - Breakpoints
- Today going to go back to talking about fractals
    - Talked about it at the beginning of class
    - Let's see who remembers
- Before we get started, do a quick drawing exercise
    - Show a picture of a tree
    - Have them draw a "speed tree"
        - Give ~2m
        - Giving them too long will ruin the before/after effect
- Going to watch a bit of a movie and then discuss
    - Mandelbrot movie: https://youtu.be/d0Exnv8Ym7s?si=7nmgnrCIPdN9ThH5
        - Ads from 2:00 - 2:35
        - Watch up to 24:46 (fractal tee-shirts)
- What did we learn there?
    - What are fractals?
    - How are trees like fractals?
    - Why are fractals so common in nature (and in humans)?
- Show various fractal demos
    - Fern: https://youtu.be/Zh4oVYty61M?si=34V-WuqAFQC64uN2
- Have them redraw a tree
    - Show before and after
    - Combine all the trees into one big class tree
        - Each of their trees is a branch on the big tree
- Recursion setup
    - In CS this is called recursion
    - Functions
    - Show tree example
