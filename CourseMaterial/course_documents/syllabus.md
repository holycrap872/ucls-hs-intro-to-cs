# Introduction to Computer Science

This yearlong course aims to more deeply explore what computers are and how they
work. Students will learn why computers must use zeros and ones, how this can be
used to represent different kinds of data, and how that data can be stored,
transmitted and manipulated by algorithms / computer code. This half-credit
course will meet throughout the entire year but only for two days each week.

## Learning Objectives

- To learn binary (the number system of electrical machines) and various data /
  file formats that use this to represent other kinds of data.
- To learn the Python programming language which they will use to implement
  algorithms which manipulate data.
- To enhance problem solving skills to enable students to approach large,
  complex problems and break them down into more manageable pieces.

## Required Texts and Materials

No texts are required. All instructional materials will be posted on Schoology.

Students will need access to a personal computer at home on which they can
install programs and do their homework. Any desktop or laptop computer (i.e.,
not a phone or a tablet) will suffice as long as it's **not a Chromebook**.
Windows, Mac, or Linux machines will all work fine.

## Expectations

Generally, I expect you to be invested in the class and to be an active and
positive member of our classroom community. In addition, I expect you to take
your development seriously as a reader, writer, and programmer. The following
are some specific guidelines that will help you to meet these expectations:

- Come to class prepared. This means you should have completed all of the
  assignments due for that day’s class, and you should have annotated the text
  of any assigned reading.
- Remain open-minded and sensitive during class discussions.
- Laptops, Cell Phones, Ipads, and other electronic devices are useful tools but
  also wonderful distractions. Your laptop should be charged for class, but
  it should only be open when instructed. **Place your cell phones in your
  backpack. If you need to use it during class, raise your hand and explain
  the situation when I come over to talk to you.**
- I expect each of you to make a solid, good-faith effort to do your best in
  this class (and I expect the same from myself). I know, however, that this
  class is just one of many aspects of your life, so please talk to me if you
  need help doing your best work.
- If you have questions or concerns, please ask me anytime. Also, please ask
  if you don’t know why we’re doing something or if you have a better idea.

In addition to the above expectations, you should complete all assignments and
readings to the best of your abilities, setting and achieving high standards for
your work. This desired work ethic includes demonstrating a willingness to seek
guidance, to take suggestions with open-mindedness, and to act on the feedback
received in revising assignments and preparing future work.

## Coursework

Assignments for this course can be broken up into different types which will
typically involve:

- Classwork (during class): This will involve programming challenges which
  you will complete individually or with partners to practice the concepts
  that are presented. Usually, you will be able to finish the regular
  (non-extension) parts of these assignments during class. Regular parts that
  aren’t completed during class time will usually need to be finished outside of
  class time _before_ the next class period. **Late classwork will not receive
  credit.** While classwork will be graded based on completion (honest attempt)
  and not correctness, you are encouraged to follow up on non-functioning code
  with me outside of class time.
- Homework (after class): Standard assignments (done individually) to practice
  and develop mastery of the material covered in class. Students will always
  have at least two days to complete assignments. They will never be assigned
  to be due the next day.
- Quizzes: Straightforward programming and multiple-choice questions to ensure
  your understanding of the terminology and the application of the concepts of
  the course.
- Projects: Sometimes classwork and homework will be part of a continuing
  group project. In this case, you will have to schedule time outside of class
  to work with your partner. This could be done using Zoom or Google Meet.
- Exams: End of unit or end of semester tests that evaluate your understanding
  of the material. Exams will be announced at least one week beforehand.

At the beginning of the year, classwork and homework will either be submitted:
manually at the _beginning_ of the next class or by uploading it to Schoology
the night before the next class (11:59 PM). Later in the course, it will be
submitted by saving the work to a Google Drive folder which students will share
with their instructor (also by 11:59 PM before the next class). Quizzes will
be done on Schoology. 

Late or revised homework, projects and quizzes will be accepted with a
letter-grade penalty up until the end of a unit. Once we move on to the next
unit, no late or revised work from the prior units will be accepted. In practice,
though, you will want to complete any missing assignments as soon as possible as
future work will build on previously covered concepts.

## Grading and Assessment

Units will be weighted according to the amount of time that we spend on them,
and unit grades will be broken down into the following categories:

- Classwork: 10%
- Homework: 25%
- Quizzes: 25%
- Exams: 40%

Grades for assignments will be posted on Schoology. You can expect to get a
progress report at the end of each unit.

## Time Expectations

You should expect one to two hours of homework per week. This breaks down to
about 30 minutes to one hour of homework after each class period.

With programming, it is very easy to get stuck. You are advised to start early
on assignments so that if you do get stuck, you will be able to take advantage
of the many times that I am available for appointments.

## Course Scope & Sequence and/or Course Calendar

The time required to cover the various units in this course may vary but this is
the general sequence and approximate length of the topics we will cover.
Students can expect an assessment at the end of each of these units:

- Digital representation of numbers and text (5 weeks)
- Introduction to programming (8 weeks)
- Digital representation of images (4 weeks)
- Image processing project (8 weeks)
- Efficient storage and transmission of data (5 weeks)

## Academic Integrity Policy

You are encouraged to work together with your fellow classmates during class
time on activities, but homework assignments (unless otherwise noted) are meant
to be done individually. This is because these assignments are meant to assess
whether you have grasped the material and can complete the problems without
outside help.

You are required to turn in your own work. Copying/pasting from **any** source
without citation is not acceptable. Looking at someone else's code and retyping
it is not acceptable. Discussing an assignment with other students and helping
other students troubleshoot broken code is acceptable, but you should never
dictate your code to another student but should, rather, guide them along a path
of inquiry.

The spirit of this policy is to make sure that you are the owner of the work
you are producing. If you are unable to explain a solution you produce, you
will receive a zero for the assignment and the Dean of Students will be
notified.

## Accommodations Statement

All of us learn in different ways and the organization of any course may need
to accommodate each student differently. For example, you may prefer to process
information by speaking and listening, so that some of the written material for
this course may be difficult to absorb. Please talk to me as soon as you can
about your individual learning needs and how this course can best accommodate
them. If you require accommodations to participate fully in this course, please
let me know as soon as possible.

## Email Policy

Generally, I do not check email between 7pm and 7am (the next school day).
Students who email me during these hours should not expect a response until
after 7am.

## Absence Policy

If you miss a class, you should review the materials on Schoology and follow up
with me if there’s anything there that you don’t understand.
