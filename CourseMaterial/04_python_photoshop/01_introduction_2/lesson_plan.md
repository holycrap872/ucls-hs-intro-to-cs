## Essential Questions

- How can I use python to edit images?
- How do I prepare myself for a long term CS project?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- `PythoShop.zip` loaded up into Schoology
    - Built version of https://github.com/dwheadon/PythoShop/tree/bmp
    - See README.md for build instructions
- Third assignment loaded up in Schoology
    - Changing multiple pixels

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - PythoShop
    - Tools vs. Filters
    - Helper functions
- Class tool
    - Create a class tool to create an x wherever the user clicks
    - Why a filter and not a tool?
    - Figure it out together
- Minutia
    - Testing
        - Don't have to worry about it now
        - Will show you in next few classes how tests get run
        - Eventually move to GoogleDrive so I can auto-grade everything
    - Cheating
        - Will get caught
        - Variable changes get caught by abstract sytax trees
        - Honestly a little hard to detect in the beginning with small programs
        - People always get caught at the end when functions get harder
        - Just work hard in class and won't have to worry about it
- Show assignment
    - Talk through
- Go!
