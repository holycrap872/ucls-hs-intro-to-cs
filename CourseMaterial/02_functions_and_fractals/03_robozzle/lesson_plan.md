        - Why are they so powerful?
- Function call stack
    - Program pauses and waits for answer from function
    - Give example

- Today starting advanced python unit with a game
    - Lightbot
        - Available on Macs, IPhones, and Android
    - If work hard, then shouldn't have any homework
        - Otherwise will have to download something at home
- Demonstration
    - Do simple level
    - Explain how their procedures are similar to python's
        - `main` pauses and waits for completion
    - How similar/different to more general programming language?
- Walk through worksheet
    - Screen shots at end of two "sets" of levels completed
        - Screen shot of 2-5 completed
        - Screen shot of 3-5 completed
