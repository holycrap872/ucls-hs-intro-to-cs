## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Marty's "Understanding Functions" worksheet
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUm30cfHlPjsch9kThEpYLBFffnHRs09aDx31ybjdBQ
    - Maybe better as a Schoology assessment with unlimited retakes?

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - What we've done so far
- Today starting to work with functions
    - Who remembers what functions are?
    - Why are they useful?
- Demo to show the power of functions
    - Dragon curve demo
    - What are the important parts of the function?
    - How is this like a fractal?
- Today going to do Grok's functions
    - Should _mostly_ be a review
    - Still read background information carefully
        - Pay particular attention to how `return` works
        - What does it mean when there's no `return`, vs `return`, vs `return x`?
- Go!

#### Homework

- All of Grok 8
