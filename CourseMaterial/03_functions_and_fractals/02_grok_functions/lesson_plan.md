## Essential Questions

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Marty's "Understanding Functions" worksheet
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GUm30cfHlPjsch9kThEpYLBFffnHRs09aDx31ybjdBQ
    - Maybe better as a Schoology assessment with unlimited retakes?

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Fractals
    - Recursion
    - Python functions
- Dragon curve demo
    - What are the important parts of the function?
    - How is this like a fractal?
- Today going to do Grok's functions
    - Should _mostly_ be a review
    - Still read background information carefully
        - Pay particular attention to how `return` works
        - What does it mean when there's no `return`, vs `return`, vs `return x`?
    - Lot of use of the `replace()` function
        - How does it work?
        - Create simple "replace single character" replace as a class
        - Real one is more complex
    - Walk through what Grok wants
        - Particular function signature (must be name they want)
        - NO `print()` (remove function calls after you test your own code)
- Go!

#### Homework

- All of Grok 7 (other than "Wordy numbers")
