## Essential Questions

- What are functions?
- Why are functions useful?

## Lesson Plan

This lesson assumes that students are coming back from break and therefore need
a bit of a refresher. For this reason, we start working on functions because it
is old stuff (code) wrapped in new stuff (functions). The lesson is composed of
twenty minutes or so of lecture with the remainder being a worksheet.

### Setup

- `real_life_functions.docx` printed out and ready to go
- `python_functions_worksheet` loaded into Schoology (as google doc)

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Common mistakes in Grok
    - Where have we seen functions before?
- What is a function?
    - Input/output
    - Look at review problem as ask which are functions?
        - print() and other()
        - What are the inputs?
        - What are the outputs?
- Before going to functions, useful to think of functions in real life
    - Anything where give something and get something back
        - Any examples?
        - Vending machine
        - Toll booth
        - Library
        - Washing machine
    - Break down vending machine example
        - What are inputs (and their type)
        - What are outputs (and their type)
- Python functions
    - Use simulated `def vending_machine(cents)` function
        - What are inputs
        - What are outputs?
    - Vending machine just sits there until it's called
- Do two other examples
    - `add_one(num)`, `greet(saying, name)`
    - In each case, identify name, inputs, outputs, function call
- Walk through `python_functions_worksheet`
    - Note: YOU MUST RUN YOUR CODE!!!
    - Go!
