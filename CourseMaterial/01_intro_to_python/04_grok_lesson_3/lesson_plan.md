## Essential Questions

- How do we make programs that react to their environment?
- Why are conditionals so powerful?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, students will be exposed to conditionals for the first time.
They will reflect on their previous experience in Scratch and make connections
with the new material. Finally, they will start to work on the Grok lesson
on if/elif.

> The lesson also includes discussion of "f-strings", but I'm going to ignore
that for now.
