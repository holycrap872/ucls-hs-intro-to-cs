## Essential Questions

- What are the main primitives in Python?
- What are operations we can do on primitives?

## Lesson Plan

This lesson will really focus on the importance of identifying what "type" of
primitive a particular part of the program is. To do this, will talk about
different operations that can be done on various primitives.

### Setup

- None

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Variables
    - Strings vs. integers
- TIL Entries
    - Find some good ones and put into slide show
- Python primitives
    - What can we do with integers
        - `+`, `*`, `-`, `print()`
    - What can we do with strings
        - `+`, `*`, `print()`, `input()`, `len()`
- `len()` function
    - Do sample problem from Grok about length of string together
    - Emphasize how confusing Grok's use of color is
        - If two colors on same line, means asking a question to user (`input`)
- Start Grok

### Homework

- TIL entry on topic of choice
- Finish Grok Module 2
