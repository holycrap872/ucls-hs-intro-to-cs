## Essential Questions

- How do we make non-deterministic programs?
- How do we output complex data?

## Lesson Plan

This lesson will really focus on the importance of getting input from the user
and providing complex output to the user.

### Setup

- `object_fishy.py` and `helisquare.py` ready to play

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Variables
    - Strings vs. integers
- TIL Entries
    - Find some good ones and put into slide show
- Input in Python
    - Space at the end
    - Return type
    - Input as a function
- F-strings
    - Stands for "format strings"
    - Show similarity to Scratch blocks
    - Importance of f at beginning
- Emphasize how confusing Grok's use of color is
    - If two colors on same line, means asking a question to user (`input`)
- Where can get to if finish Grok early
    - Fishy
        - `object_fishy.py`
    - Helisquare
        - `helisquare.py`
- Start Grok

### Homework

- TIL entry on f-strings
- Finish Grok Lesson 3.2
