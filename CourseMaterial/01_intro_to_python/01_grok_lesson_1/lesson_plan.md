## Essential Questions

- What are variables and why are they useful?
- How does Python differentiate between words and numbers?
- What operations can we perform on different data types?

## Lesson Plan

This class will formalize the knowledge that students learned in the first
module of Grok's "Python for Beginners" course, which focuses on strings,
variables, and printing. It will then cover the primitive "data types" that
Python uses: string, floats, ints. Finally, it will show students where they
can get to if they move quickly through the assignments.

### Setup

- None

### Actual Lesson

- Opening problem
    - What is the output of `val = "teacher"; print("Golly,", val, "sure sounds interesting")`
    - Find the syntax errors within these bits of code
- Grok Review
    - What did you encounter last class?
        - Strings
        - `print()`
        - Variables
        - Syntax errors
    - How do you feel about Grok?
        - Easy to understand
        - What is useful, what is hard?
- Strings vs integers
    - Why data types are important
    - `"4"` vs `4`
    - `"4" + "4"` vs `4 + 4` 
- Where can get to if finish Grok early
    - Fishy
        - `object_fishy.py`
    - Helisquare
        - `helisquare.py`
- Go Grok!
- Before end of class
    - What are some good TIL entry topics?

### Homework

- TIL entry on data types
- Finish Grok Lesson 2
