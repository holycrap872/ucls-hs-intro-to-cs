## Essential Questions

- What is a program?
- How can Grok help teach syntax and CS principles?

## Lesson Plan

This lesson has three purposes. First, it is intended to show students the power
of Python and to allow them to see how Python is similar to the previous ways
they have learned to program. This is done by showing students three different
types of Python uses and then showing them the code behind the applications.
In addition, this lesson gets students started on Grok's "Python for Beginners"
course. Finally, it serves as a bit of an advertisement for my ML/AI class.

### Setup

- Setup Grok
    - Load students into Grok via `.csv` file
    - Register students for "Python for Beginners" course
