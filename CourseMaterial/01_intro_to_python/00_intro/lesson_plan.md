## Essential Questions

- What is a program?
- How can Grok help teach syntax and CS principles?

## Lesson Plan

This lesson has two purposes. First, it is intended to show students the power
of Python and to allow them to see how Python is similar to the previous ways
they have learned to program. This is done by showing students a simple Python
program and having them notice/wonder about the code behind the application.
In addition, this lesson gets students started on Grok's `Python for Beginners`
course.

### Setup

- Setup Grok
    - Load students into Grok via `.csv` file
        - Names from exporting gradebook in Schoology
        - Emails by copying over from PowerSchool
    - Register students for `Python for Beginners` course
- Have `mood_light.py` open and ready to run
