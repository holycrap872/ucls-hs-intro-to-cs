## Essential Questions

- How can hex be used to efficiently represent information stored in a computer?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students will be given a worksheet that will lead them towards
understanding the power of hexadecimal. It will culminate with them being
prepared to articulate why hex is so commonly seen w/ computers.
