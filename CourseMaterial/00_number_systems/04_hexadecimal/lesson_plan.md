## Essential Questions

- How can hexadecimal be used to efficiently represent bytes of information?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students will be given a worksheet that will lead them towards
understanding the power of hexadecimal. It will culminate with them being
prepared to take a quiz on decimal/binary/hex at the beginning of next class.
