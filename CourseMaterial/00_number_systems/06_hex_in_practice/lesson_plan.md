## Essential Questions

- Why is hexadecimal so common in CS?
- Where do we see hexadecimal?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students see places where hex shows up in the computer. In
particular, students are introduced to topics/tools that will recur throughout
the year including HexFiend and RBG colors. Finally, the class ends with playing
"the flippy bit game".

### Setup

- Compiled version of `simple.c` (`gcc -o simple simple.c`)
- HexFiend installed on computers
- `hexfiend_classwork` GoogleDoc printed out
    - Printed b/c they're sketching
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/10esTMQ7dVPqxuLoiB1pYsntUwUWHYAAu8rS1RyC4kWs
- Flippybit GoogleDoc shared on Schoology

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Hex, decimal, binary
    - ASCII
    - Standards
- Why hex so important
    - More compact representation of binary
- Show places where hex is used
    - Colors in Microsoft Work sliders
    - Objdump
    - Wireshark
- Show HexFiend
    - HexFiend can read every single file on a computer: why?
- Open up HexFiend and show what it can do
    - Save empty file to the desktop
    - Why can't I type 0x0G?
    - Why can HexFiend open any file?
- HexFiend Demo
    - Put TextEdit and HexFiend side by side
        - Put HexFiend in "reload unmodified" mode
            - `Edit` -> `Reload Unmodified`
- Today you're going to alter fundamental bits
    - Walk through hexfiend
    - Have log in
    - Hand out worksheet
    - Go!
- Reconvene
    - What did you see?
- Start homework if there's time
    - Homework is to get above 10 in a row in flippy bit game
        - Take screenshot
    - Top three scores get candybars of their choice
