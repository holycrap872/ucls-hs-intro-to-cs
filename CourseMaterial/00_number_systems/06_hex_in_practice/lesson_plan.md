## Essential Questions

- Why is hexadecimal so common in CS?
- Where do we see hexadecimal?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students see places where hex shows up in the computer. In
particular, students are introduced to topics/tools that will recur throughout
the year including HexFiend and RBG colors. Finally, the class ends with playing
"the flippy bit game".

### Setup

- HexFiend installed on computers
- `Hexfiend Classwork` GoogleDoc loaded into Schoology
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QBQFZy7oRVLWU8Fvbh-ymdTY-KpSJ-f1M6pmo1ItcpA
- Files to operate/mess with
    - `simple.bmp`
    - `simple` executable (`gcc -o simple simple.c`)
- `Flippy Bit Homework` GoogleDoc shared on Schoology
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lYOHIIgLehjzlOMM8j1c-otZITgJmejcPuDSzgpgOBA

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Hex, decimal, binary
    - ASCII
    - Standards
- Why hex is so important
    - More compact representation of binary
- Show HexFiend
    - HexFiend can read every single file on a computer: why?
- Open up HexFiend and show what it can do
    - Save empty file to the desktop
    - Why can't I type 0x0G?
    - Why can HexFiend open any file?
- HexFiend Demo
    - Put TextEdit and HexFiend side by side
        - Put HexFiend in "reload unmodified" mode
            - `Edit` -> `Reload Unmodified`
    - Show various things
        - Side by side changes
        - Emphasize saving and how sends 1's and 0's to harddrive
        - **GO REALLY SLOW HERE...** they struggle with stuff like files etc.
- Today you're going to alter the fundamental bits stored in a computer
    - Talk through worksheet
    - Partner up (same as ASCII partners)
    - Go!
    - If finish early, have them work on Flippy Bit homework
- Reconvene
    - What did you see?
    - Unlimited power meme
- Show places where hex is used
    - Numbers
    - Text
    - Pictures
        - Edit `simple.bmp` with HexFiend
        - Make sure HexEdit is in overwrite mode
- Flippy Bit
    - Explain how game works
    - Give examples of how encode binary nibbles to hit hex digits
    - Homework is to get above 9+ in a row in flippy bit game
        - Take screenshot
    - Top score gets candybar of their choice
- Start homework if there's time

 #### Homework
 
 - TIL entry on topic of choice
 - Flippy bit game
