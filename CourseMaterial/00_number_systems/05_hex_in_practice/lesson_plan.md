## Essential Questions

- Why is hexadecimal so common in CS?
- Where do we see hexadecimal 

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students see places where hex shows up in the computer. In
particular, students are introduced to topics/tools that will recur throughout
the year including HexFiend and RBG colors. Finally, the class ends with playing
"the flippy bit game" to bring a little fun to what's been a bit of a boring
slog.

### Setup

- RGB lattice for demo purposes
- Compiled version of `simple.c` (`gcc -o simple simple.c`)
- Candy for the person who gets highest score in "the flippy bit game"

### Actual Lesson

- Collect homework
- Reminder: Quiz on hex and binary
    - If finish early, can play flippy bit game
    - High score gets a candy bar
- Review
    - Hex, decimal, binary
- Pictures
    - When in MS did black/white
    - Do picture of tea cup
- How do colored picture?
    - Lick thumb and put it on phone: what colors do you see?
    - RGB
    - Show RGB lattice
    - Decode a picture together
- RGB formally
    - Sliders in word
        - Relate to lattice
    - 3 bytes per color
- Hex in real images
    - HexFiend of bitmap
        - `simple.bmp`
    - Represent/guess various colors
    - Will eventually do this at end of year
- Hex in real code
    - Show c program that just prints out "hello" (`simple.c`)
    - Explain (briefly) compilation
        - `gcc -o simple simple.c`
    - Show objdump of program
        - `objdump -D simple | less`
- Do bunch of hex memes
    - Why are they funny?
- Show flippy bit game
    - High score gets candy

 #### Homework
 
 - Schoology assessment
    - Based on `assessment.md`
    - 20 retakes
 - TIL on RGB and Hex
