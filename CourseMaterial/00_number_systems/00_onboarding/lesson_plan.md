### Homework

```
FIRST: Make sure you're using your UCLS Google account. You **MUST** use your
UCLS Google account to make this appointment or you will not get credit for this
assignment.

SECOND: Go to the main page for this course and navigate into the "Course
Documents" folder. Click on the "Appointment Calendar" link.

THIRD: Setup a **FAKE** appointment to see your instructor sometime on either
September 16th (Saturday), September 17th (Sunday), or September 23 (Saturday).
This is a fake appointment, so you should not actually come in for it but you
should **remember the time** of the appointment.

FOURTH: Drop by the Computer Science office and tell me the time of your
appointment so I can verify that you have your timezone setup correctly. If I am
NOT THERE, write you name and your appointment time on the whiteboard outside
my desk.

This will prove that you know how to use my appointment calendar AND you know
where the Computer Science office is located, so there is no excuse for not
utilizing this resource in the future.
