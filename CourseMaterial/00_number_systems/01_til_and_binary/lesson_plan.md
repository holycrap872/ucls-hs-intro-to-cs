## Essential Questions:

- How do I solidify my understanding of difficult material?
- How do computers store and represent certain types of information?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this class is two-fold. First, in introduces students to the
long-running "Today I Learned" GoogleDoc. This document is intended to be a way
for students to identify topics they are confused about and work through their
confusion. Second, we will start to talk about "digital representation" by
talking about binary numbers.

### Setup

- YouTube video loaded up
    - Infinite fern: https://youtu.be/Zh4oVYty61M?si=34V-WuqAFQC64uN2
- Josh's GitHub repo up and ready to talk about
- TIL template deployed on Schoology
    - Template: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ynScUCTYosNu9PKraO--jkVsilk-S9OxNUXmhR1HxsI
    - Rubric: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j5vw3IYppMSfC5TPs2JEx6PjW4-oDo8FrpmEhXEj7lA

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Syllabus
    - Recursion
        - https://youtu.be/Zh4oVYty61M?si=34V-WuqAFQC64uN2
        - How is this like recursion?
- Before starting first unit, going to cover "Today I Learned"
    - Show Josh's
        - https://github.com/jbranchaud/til
        - Go into `chrome` folder and find something interesting
    - Why is this useful?
        - Forces identification/articulation of confusion
        - Easy to reload past knowledge
    - Talk through template
    - Talk through rubric
        - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j5vw3IYppMSfC5TPs2JEx6PjW4-oDo8FrpmEhXEj7lA
    - TIL is cheat-sheet you can bring to any test/exam in class
        - Can do multiple entries per day
        - I will grade the "worst one" to avoid note dumping
- First unit will be on "digital representation"
    - What does "digital" mean?
    - What does "digital representation" mean?
- What do people know about how information is stored on a computer?
    - Only thing computers understand: 1's and 0's -> binary
    - Today going to talk about binary
- Basically do CS Unplugged lesson on binary
    - 5 volunteers
        - Each gets a dot
    - Have them do certain numbers
        - 1
        - 13
        - 23
        - 0
    - Have them count up from 0 - 16
        - Can anyone see the patterns?
- Do two board problems on board
    - decimal -> binary
    - binary -> decimal
- Can store more than 10 numbers on fingers
    - Lot of people show me the number four whenever I drive
    - 132 if I did something very aggressive
- How much can a _x_ store:
    - Octopus
    - Upside down elephant
    - Star fish
    - Penguin
- TIL homework
    - Tonight doing a TIL on binary numbers
    - What would a good entry look like?
        - Write one together
