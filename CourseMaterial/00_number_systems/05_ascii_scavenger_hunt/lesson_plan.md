## Essential Questions

- How do computers represent symbols and text beyond just 1's and 0's?
- How do different number systems enable us to quickly look up symbols?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students embark on a scavenger hunt. For each clue, they have to
decode a series of numbers into text. The clues get progressively more difficult
and lead the students towards appreciating the power and usefulness of ASCII.
At the end of class, there is a discussion about the importance of standards
and protocols for allowing people to communicate.

### Setup

- Scavenger hunt set up
    - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6gDOtzs0r-PXiVjRgclm6DzgXySXCEntQzXS9CB3tU
        - Clue 1: Decimal to a: 1, b: 2 (spaces included)
        - Clue 2: Decimal to a: 1, b: 2 (0 for spaces)
        - Clue 3: Ambiguous/impossible decimal
        - Clue 4: 2-digit decimal fixed width
        - Clue 5: 3-digit decimal to ASCII
        - Clue 6: Binary to hex to ASCII
    - Clues distributed around school
        - Put into envelopes with name/date/time on envelopes

### Actual Lesson

- Collect homework
- Review
    - Hex, binary, decimal
        - Do a few conversion problems on the board
    - Bits, bytes, nibbles
- TIL entries
    - Review a few on hex
    - "Grade" as a class
- Today, going to do a scavenger hunt
    - Pair up
        - New pairs that I pick
    - Go over rules
        - Timer of 5m every time you leave the classroom.
        - Come back when find clue!!!
    - Each group has their own unique path, so don't follow others
- Go!
    - Walk around and suggest ways to divide the work
    - Watch for groups on the "ambiguous clue" so don't waste lots of time
- Reconvene with 10m left
- ASCII
    - Standard agreement
    - Add on characters at the end
    - Encode/Decode a few example phrases
- Talk about standards
    - Why so important
    - What other standards?
    Show pictures and see if students can identify standards in them:
        - Roads
        - Traffic lights
        - RGB
