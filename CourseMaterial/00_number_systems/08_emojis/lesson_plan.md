## Essential Questions

- How are characters beyond ASCII encoded?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students are exploring how altering hex encodings can result
in changing the text/emojis stored in a text file. The class begins with a
little fun in the form of emoji riddles. Then, students work through a emoji
worksheet that has them using HexFiend to create/alter emojis.

### Setup

- `emoji_classwork` GoogleDoc printed out
    - Printed b/c they're sketching
