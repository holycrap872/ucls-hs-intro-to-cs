## Learning Objective:

- Understand how bits can represent color
- Be able to encode and decode simple bitmaps

## Essential Questions:

- How do computers store and represent certain types of information?
- How do I solidify my understanding of difficult material?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Syllabus
    - Recursion
- First unit will be on "digital representation"
- Today going to talk about pictures
- What do people know about how pictures are stored on a computer?
    - Only thing computers understand: 1's and 0's
    - Each picture broken down into things called pixels
        - Show in preview
        - Zoom in
        - Just a bunch of small rectangles stuck together
- Start easy
    - How represent black and white?
        - 0 represent black (turn lights off)
        - 1 represent white (turn lights on)
- Do two examples together
    - Teacup Picture
        - Ask them if they can see what it is
        - First row would be encoded 1,1,1, ...
        - How would next row be encoded?
            - Next row is 1, 0, 0, ...
        - Missing row is encoded 1, seven 0's, 1, 1, 0, 1
    - House Picture
        - Have student come up
        - Decode the following for me
        - Missing rows are:
            - two 1's, one 0, seven 1's, one 0, one 1
            - three 1's, seven 0's, two 1's
- Today going to make our own art
    - Going to make your own black and white design on this paper
    - Encode it and trade it with someone
    - Share to see if you came up with the right thing
- After the bring everyone back together
    - What did we learn?
    - What is different between what we did and real pictures?
- How do we get more colors?
    - More bits!
    - RGB
    - Put a little water on your phone
    - RGB slider in word
    - RGB Lattice
- Pixels can be anything
    - What are some examples?
        Legos
