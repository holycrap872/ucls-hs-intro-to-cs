## Essential Questions

- How do computers represent symbols and text beyond just 1's and 0's?
- How do different number systems enable us to quickly look up symbols?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students embark on a scavenger hunt. For each clue, they have to
decode a series of numbers into text. The clues get progressively more difficult
and lead the students towards appreciating the power and usefulness of ASCII.
At the end of class, there is a discussion about the importance of standards
and protocols for allowing people to communicate.
