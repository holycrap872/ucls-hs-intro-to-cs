## Essential Questions:

- What are ways to represent numbers other than as decimals?
- How can we convert between different number systems?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students will first get feedback on their TIL's and be able to
discuss any questions they have. After that, the class will break up into pairs
and students will start to work on the "cashbox worksheet". The point of this
activity is to expose students to different base-X number systems. While the
worksheet is self-contained, care should be given to highlight how the previous
class on binary relates.

### Setup

- Odometer site loaded up
    - https://studio.code.org/s/odometer/lessons/1/levels/1
- `cashboxes_classwork` GoogleDoc printed out
    - Printed b/c they're sketching
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1esNFXNXknUZ8u6ecfAX23CCBElGLJUJnZ275CTJN3lY

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - TIL
    - Binary
    - Show Odometer
        - https://studio.code.org/s/odometer/lessons/1/levels/1
        - What do you notice for decimal?
        - What do you notice for binary?
- TIL reviews
    - Good examples
    - Bad examples
    - Will eventually "spin the wheel" so be prepared
- Today going to continue to talk about number systems
    - What are number systems you know about?
- Going to do the activity in pairs
    - Pair programming roles: driver and navigator
    - Explain
        - Switch 
        - Only navigator can ask questions
    - Pair programming theater
- Explain activity
    - Work through in pairs
    - Once finish one sheet, will get the next one
    - Hand out first sheet
    - Give chance to read through
    - Any questions?
- Go!

#### Homework

- TIL on topic of your choice
