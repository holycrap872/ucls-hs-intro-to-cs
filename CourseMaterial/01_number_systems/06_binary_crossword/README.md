## Lesson:

- Break up into pairs
- Give half the pairs page 1 to work on and half the pairs page 2
- Let everyone solve
    - For kids that finish early:
        - Have them create _more_ questions for "come up with your own question" sections
        - Have them create replacement questions for ones I already had
- Come back together and share the fact two different puzzles with same answers
    - How?
    - Why?
        - Binaries just really store 1s and 0s... just matters how you look at it
- Favorite question for those who did page 1?
- Favorite question for those who did page 2?
- What questions did people come up with for question 

Bonus questions:
- DEADBEEF is very common in programs, why?
- Why aren't we constantly confused in math
    - Assumed we're in Binary
