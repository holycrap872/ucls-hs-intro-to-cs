## Essential Questions

- How do we represent text with hex?
- Why is context important when decoding data in a computer?

## Lesson:

In this class, students are basically reviewing ASCII. There are two mini
activities that address this. First, students are exposed to HexFiend where
they write their own joke in hex. Second, students do (a part of) a binary
crossword puzzle. The point of the puzzle is that numbers require context in
order to be properly understood.

### Setup

- `bits_and_binary_review.pdf` printed out

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Scavenger hunt
    - ASCII

- Break up into pairs
- Give half the pairs page 1 to work on and half the pairs page 2
- Let everyone solve
    - For kids that finish early:
        - Have them create _more_ questions for "come up with your own question" sections
        - Have them create replacement questions for ones I already had
- Come back together and share the fact two different puzzles with same answers
    - How?
    - Why?
        - Binaries just really store 1s and 0s... just matters how you look at it
- Favorite question for those who did page 1?
- Favorite question for those who did page 2?
- What questions did people come up with for question 

Bonus questions:
- DEADBEEF is very common in programs, why?
- Why aren't we constantly confused in math
    - By convention, we're in decimal

> Notes: I changed the answer for question 22 from APPLE -> BEEF
