## Essential Questions

- How can we use a minimal set of symbols to represent all numbers

## Lesson Plan

Today we are reviewing and building on the previous two lessons that had to do
with binary and hexadecimal. Student's will revisit how different number systems
work and then learn new language having to do with the size of information
with words like GigaByte, TeraByte, etc.

### Setup

- Youtube videos loaded up
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy6-FXtLMV8

### Lesson Plan

- Opening Problem
- Review last class
    - Different cashboxes
    - Base 10 -> decimal
    - Base 2 -> binary
    - How did convert between decimal number and binary cash box
    - "Pushup comic" discussion
        - Need either d or b prefix
- TIL debrief
    - Show some good examples
    - Have students grade partner's TIL
- Today going to talk a more about binary
- Show different odometers for number systems

- Two on board problems
    - decimal -> binary
