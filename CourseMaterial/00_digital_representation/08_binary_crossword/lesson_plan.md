## Essential Questions

- How do we represent images with hex?
- Why is context important when decoding data in a computer?

## Lesson:

In this class, students are basically reviewing hex representation in computers.
Students do (a part of) a binary crossword puzzle. The point of the puzzle is
that numbers require context in order to be properly understood.

### Setup

- RGB lattice for demo purposes
- Candy for students who got highest scores in "the flippy bit game"
- `bits_and_binary_review.pdf` printed out

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - ASCII
    - Hex
    - HexFiend
- Today going to talk about other kinds of data
    - So far: numbers, text
- Pictures
    - When in MS did black/white
    - Do picture of tea cup
- How do colored picture?
    - Lick thumb and put it on phone: what colors do you see?
    - RGB
    - Show RGB lattice
- RGB formally
    - Sliders in word
        - Relate to lattice
    - 3 bytes per color
- Decode a small picture together
- Set up binary crossword
    - Do small example in slide show
- Binary crossword
    - Break up into pairs
    - Give half the pairs page 1 to work on and half the pairs page 2
    - Let everyone solve
        - For kids that finish early:
            - Have them create _more_ questions for "come up with your own question" sections
            - Have them create replacement questions for ones I already had
- Come back together and share the fact two different puzzles with same answers
    - How?
    - Why?
        - Binaries just really store 1s and 0s... just matters how you look at it
    - Favorite question for those who did page 1?
    - Favorite question for those who did page 2?
- What questions did people come up with for your own custom question 
- Bonus questions:
    - 0xDEADBEEF is very common in programs, why?
    - Why aren't we constantly confused in math
        - By convention, we're in decimal

## Homework

- TIL entry on RGB
- Finish `bits_and_binary_review.pdf`
    - Note: I changed the answer for question 22 from 0xAPPLE -> 0xBEEF
