## Essential Questions

- How can we use a minimal set of symbols to represent all numbers

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students review and build on the previous two lessons (binary
and cashboxes). Students will revisit how different number systems work and
then learn new language having to do with the size of information with words
like bit, byte, nibble.

### Setup

- Various "odometers" loaded up
    - https://studio.code.org/s/odometer/lessons/1/levels/1
        - Use dev tools to delete `<tr>` for Octal and "Custom"
- YouTube videos loaded up
    - Cardboard Odometer: https://youtu.be/v83Uvg_ySK8?si=v3vHeVW9aANa8eal&t=8
    - Gandalf: https://youtu.be/i6LGJ7evrAg?si=1OSXS3fVbOS8tNrK
- `binary_hw` GoogleDoc printed out
    - Printed b/c they have to show their work and draw
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OVhUWFlEIlsp_gH8zQgWGpHzvemCEDKYeitS9gKngZ8
