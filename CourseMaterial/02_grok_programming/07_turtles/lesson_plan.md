## Essential Questions

- How should we visualize if/elif/else and loops?
- How do we use loops to model repeating patterns?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson is to prepare students for loops. This is because Grok's
loop lesson is a big jump in difficulty. Therefore, this lesson is intended to
ease the students into the syntax and appreciate loops as things that can
exploit patterns. In particular, I really stress the "logic puzzle-ness" of
being able to identify and exploit patterns with loops.
